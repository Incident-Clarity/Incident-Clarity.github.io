## Steps to send a message using PGP on Linux:

- Copy the public key into a file, example: `recipientkey.asc`

- Import the public key using this command: `gpg --import recipientkey.asc`

- When you import the key, there is an *email* associated with it, **note it**.

- Now encrypt your message with my PGP key: `gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r email_you_noted@example.com message.txt`

## How to Decrypt an encrypted message?

- This can only be performed by the person who has the **Private key**: `gpg --decrypt message.txt.asc > decrypted_message.txt`
