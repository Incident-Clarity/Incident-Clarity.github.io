## Advanced ELK Queries

**Learning Objective**

- Learn about different advanced queries
- Learning about different query syntaxes (KibanaÂ Query Language and Lucene)

### Task 1: A Primer on Advanced Queries

- **Syntaxes**
  - Kibana supports two query languages: KQL (Kibana Query Language) and Lucene Query Syntax.
  - **KQL**: User-friendly, provides autocomplete suggestions, supports various operators and functions.
  - **Lucene**: More powerful, harder to learn, used in Elasticsearch and other search engines.

- **Special Characters**
  - Reserved characters in ELK queries: +, -, =, &&, ||, &, |, !.
  - To use reserved characters, precede them with a backslash (e.g., `username:User\+1`).

- **Wildcards**
  - `*`: Matches any number of characters (e.g., `product_name:monit*`).
  - `?`: Matches a single character (e.g., `name:J?n`).

**Questions:**
1. How do you escape the text "password:Me&Try=Hack!" (Not including the double quotes)
	- `password:Me\&Try\=Hack\!`

2. Using wildcards, what will your query be if you want to search for all documents that contain the words "hacking" and "hack" in the "activity" field?
	- `activity:hack*`
