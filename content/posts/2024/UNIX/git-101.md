## Git 101
---

**Discover Git: The version control software that is used to manage this website as a repository on GitHub.**


I will be listing out various things about git and how it works; and how you can use it :)


## 101-01: Version Control
---

**Git**

This is a free and open source version control system.

**Version Control**

This is managing changes to a file, folder, or a program, or a website like [Incident Clarity](https://incident-clarity.github.io/). Giving a version to the changes made. Example: v01 is old, v02 is new.

**Repository**

Project or a folder where your files are kept. 


**Github**

A website to host your repository.

Is there only one way to host your repository? ***NO***

Here are a few more ways to host your git repository: 

- [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)
- [GitLab CE](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Gogs](https://gogs.io/)
- [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/)
- Host your own server using SSH or Gitea (I love this)



## 101-02: Git Commands
---


- **git init**: Boot up a new Git repository; it's like creating your own digital fortress.
- **git clone {repo}**: Duplicate a repository to your local machine; think of it as creating a local honeypot.
- **git add {file}**: Stage changes for the next commit. This creates the v02 (as per my above example)
- **git commit -m "message"**: Save staged changes with a message; think of it as leaving a breadcrumb trail for your mess.
- **git status**: Check the status of your working directory.
- **git log**: View commit history; your chronological evidence of code.
- **git diff**: Compare differences between your commits.
- **git branch**: List, create, or delete branches.
- **git checkout {branch}**: Switch to another branch.
- **git merge {branch}**: Combine changes from another branch.


## 101-03: [GitHub](https://github.com/)
---

Go to the website, solve the problem given, create an account, and you are ready for action.

Create a new public repository called `Public_Repo`; we will use this later in the tutorial.

Create a file called README.md within the `Public_Repo`.


**Creating an SSH keys**

To push any of your **repository** to github using the CLI, for an ease of use, we will create an SSH key.

**Commands:**

**Creating the key:**
```sh
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@domain.com"
# give it a name
~/.ssh/github-ssh # name is github-ssh
# Add a passphrase for security (or leave it black, live the wild life)
```

**Copying the key:**

```sh
ls ~/.ssh | grep git
    github-ssh
    github-ssh.pub
# This creates 2 files; A public key (github-ssh.pub) and a Private key (github-ssh).
# Private key is yours, dont share it with anyone
# Copy the public key.
cat ~/.ssh/github-ssh.pub | wl-copy
# Use the above command if you have wayland compositor (and wl-copy installed)
# for mac -> pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github-ssh.pub
```

**Now, go to [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) and add this key which you just coppied.**

**Let's make sure the CLI know that you generated a key.**

```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" 
ssh-add
```

**Add the following to the file ~/.ssh/config if it's not already there.**

```sh
Host github.com
  User git
  Hostname github.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-ssh
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

**Finally, test your connection with the key**
```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempts to ssh to GitHub
# You will see:
#  Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## 101-05: Working with Git repos
---

### Method 1
---

Clone the repository we just created on GitHub using the SSH .

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Username/Public_Repo.git
# Add contents to your README.md file
echo "Hi, This is some test text" > README.md
git add .              
git commit -m "Modifying README.md" -m "Comment"
git push -u origin main
```

Now when you do a git push the main branch, it will ask you for your **ssh key password** that you set while creating the (**github-ssh**) file. If everything worked correctly, your modification is not recorded and pushed to GitHub for anyone to see at https://github.com/Username/Public_Repo


### Method 2
---


Now, Let's say you did not create a repository using git at first.

We have a folder called, `repo-demo-2` ; this is a different repository 

`cd repo-demo-2`

**Make files or folders inside the directory.**

```sh
touch README.md
echo "Demo 2" > README.md
mkdir private_folder
touch private_folder/file.txt
```

**Now turn this `repo-demo-2` direcotry into a git repository.**


```sh
# Initialized the git repository in this folder
git init

# This shows that files and folders are created but not monitored (untracked)
git status

# Add all the files and folders we just created
git add .

git commit -m "Created Readme and text.txt" -m "Comment here"

# Set the branch to main
git branch -M main

# Now let's push this to a remote repository on github
# Create an empty repository called repo-demo-2
git remote add origin git@github.com:Username/repo-demo-2.git

# Confirm that remote repository is added using: git remove -v
git push -u origin main

# It will prompt for your ssh key password
```

**This will make your `repo-demo-2` directory into a git repository.**

**Now you can clone the same repository on any computer.**


`git clone git@github.com:Username/repo-demo-2.git`

## 101-06: Git Branches
---

Just like the **main** branch, we can create different branches to for various purposes.

This is enough to get started with Git and GitHub.
