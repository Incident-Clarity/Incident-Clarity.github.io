### Step 3: Build a Register and Assess Your Risks
Create a risk register and conduct thorough assessments to manage and mitigate potential security risks to your organization.

### Step 4: Write up an SOA
Draft a Statement of Applicability that details the ISO controls applicable to your organization and explains why certain controls are omitted.

### Step 5: Document Everything
Set up necessary policies and procedures as required by ISO 27001. Utilize compliance automation tools for templates to simplify this process.

### Step 6: Set Up and Review Your Controls
Ensure your workplace systems and policies reflect the documented controls and comply with ISO standards.

### Step 7: Train Employees on ISO Standards
Implement regular training sessions to educate employees on ISO 27001 standards and incorporate a culture of security within your team.

### Step 8: Undergo an Internal Audit
Prepare for the official audit by conducting an internal review of your new systems and controls.
