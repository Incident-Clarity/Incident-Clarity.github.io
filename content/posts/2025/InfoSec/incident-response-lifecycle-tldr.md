## 1. Preparation
- **Policies & Procedures**: Develop or refine Incident Response (IR) policies, roles, and responsibilities so everyone knows how to act when an incident occurs.  
- **Tools & Resources**: Maintain ready-to-use security solutions, forensic toolkits, and log management systems.  
- **Training & Awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions and simulations (tabletop exercises) to keep your team prepared.

## 2. Identification
- **Detection of Indicators**: Monitor for alerts and abnormal behavior (e.g., unusual login times, network traffic spikes).  
- **Assess the Severity**: Determine if itâ€™s a genuine incident or a false alarm, and rate its potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
- **Documentation**: Record all initial findings, including timestamps and relevant logs (e.g., system logs, network captures).

## 3. Containment
- **Short-Term Containment**: Immediately isolate or segment compromised systems to limit further damage (e.g., quarantining infected hosts, disabling malicious accounts).  
- **Evidence Preservation**: While containing, preserve critical data for forensic analysis (e.g., memory dumps, disk images).  
- **Long-Term Strategy**: Develop and implement broader containment measures (e.g., adjusting firewall rules, enhancing monitoring) as investigation continues.

## 4. Eradication
- **Remove the Threat**: Eliminate all malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized accounts from affected systems.  
- **Patch & Update**: Apply security patches, adjust configurations, and address root causes to prevent recurrence.  
- **Verification**: Perform scans or tests to confirm that the threat is fully removed and no hidden traces remain.

## 5. Recovery
- **Restore Systems**: Bring systems back online methodically (often in stages). Confirm they are secured, hardened, and verified to be clean.  
- **Monitor for Recurrence**: Closely track network traffic, logs, and alerts for any indication of the threat re-emerging.  
- **Documentation**: Record all actions taken to restore operations, including timelines and individuals involved.

## 6. Lessons Learned (Post-Incident Activity)
- **Review the Incident**: Conduct a post-mortem to evaluate what happened, what worked, and where improvements are needed.  
- **Update Procedures & Policies**: Integrate lessons learned into IR plans, detection tools, and training modules.  
- **Reporting & Sharing**: When applicable, share relevant details with stakeholders, regulatory bodies, or ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers).

### Why Each Phase Matters
- **Preparation** prevents being caught off guard.  
- **Identification** ensures you act quickly before threats spread.  
- **Containment** and **Eradication** help control damage and remove malicious elements.  
- **Recovery** enables a safe return to normal operations.  
- **Lessons Learned** drives continuous improvements, reducing future risk.
