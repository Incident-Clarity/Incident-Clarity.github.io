**Answer:** ISO 27001 addresses risk management through a **systematic and structured approach** for **identifying, assessing and managing** to ensure the **CIA** of information. 


The process includes:

- **Risk Assessment**: **Systematic identification and evaluation of information security risks.** (vulnerabilities + threat to those assets + potential impact of security incident)
- **Risk Identification**: **Identify and catalog assets** (info, systems, process) and identifying **potential threats** and vulnerabilities for CIA
- **Risk Analysis**: Analyzing **risks to** the **assets** based on their **potential impact and likelihood**.
- **Risk Evaluation**: Assessing the **significance of risks identified** against organizational *risk criterion*.
- **Risk Treatment**: (*Risks deemed unexceptionable*) Implementing appropriate **measures to mitigate unacceptable risks**. (Specific controls are placed to mitigate these risks)
- **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**: **Documenting** the **controls chosen** by the organization **based on** the **risk assessment**.
- **Implementation of Controls**: **Apply**ing the **chosen** measures (**Controls**) to manage identified risks.
- **Monitoring and Review**: Ongoing **evaluat**ion to ensure the **controls** effectively manage the risks.
- **Continuous Improvement**: **Regular updates** and improvements to the risk management process. 



### Question 4: What is the importance of asset classification and control in the context of ISO 27001? {#4}
---

**Answer:**
**Asset classification and controls** are very important  in ISO 27001 as they form a robust ISMS. 

**Asset classification and controls** are <u>fundamental elements providing structural approach to manage risk</u>. ISMS posture is *enhanced*.

Asset classification and control in ISO 27001 prioritize **protecting valuable assets** by **identifying and applying appropriate security controls** based on their sensitivity and importance.
